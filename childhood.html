                <h2>A Journey <span>Through Time</span></h2>
                <h5></h5>
                <p>I was born in the year 1999, by two aweinspiting parents who showed me love and took care of me and they have 
                  contimously continued to show their love and care for me.
                  My parents raised me in Ukambani lands, where i grew up getting accustomed to the Kambs culture. At my young age, 
                  i enjoyed grazing the cows and goats , which i did with the compoany of my fellow freinds who we grew together(Age mates).
                  I grew growing to church because all my parrents used to go to church and i was introduced to such life  at my 
                  young age. I have grown keep a keeping my intergrity and believes i was taught to follow.<br>
                  Every christmas, i used to meet my grandparents, uncles, aunties and well as my cousins and nephews. This used to be my 
                  happy moment because we used to do it when schools are closed. This was something necessary in my life and i used to meet 
                  and share more with everyone and enjoy the company. My grandparenst used to enjoy it as it was a very happy moment for them 
                  as they used to enjoy seing their children and grand children.<br>
                  Despite the fact that my grandparents are deceased, appreciate that they taught me some virtues that my parents could not 
                  teach me. They were strict and loved discipline and really appreciate for the good seed they planted inside me.
